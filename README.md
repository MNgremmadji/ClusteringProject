As I realised internship in image processing, I learned a lot of thing think about image processing. The folder named Internship holds all code, research paper I used and my report. I used variational approach. The folder Certification contains all code I made When I followed Udemy certification about image processing. The last folder named Lab contains All Lab I realised in image processing, as well as at Universit√© Paris 6 than my personal work.
